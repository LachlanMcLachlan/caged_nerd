# caged_nerd
Helps guitarists practice chords all the way up the neck. 

Unlimited time offer: learn the first 12 frets and get another 12 free (of effort)!

Heard of the CAGED system for chords? It's a system of shapes which allows you to play the same chord all the way up the neck.

I'm terrible at using it. I always find myself reaching for a capo so that I can play the same open chord shapes
I'm used to. But life needn't be this way.

Caged_nerd is a command-line interface which, once installed, 
allows you to enter in a key of your choice (e.g. 'D Dorian', 'B Flat Mixolydian', or good old 'C Major') and the number
of chords you want to run through.

It then asks you to play chords within that key, asking you to play then using a form from the CAGED system. 
e.g. 'find the chord E major in the C form'

Once you find the chord, hit the space bar.

Once you're session has finished (i.e. you've played the number of chords you said you would), caged_nerd gives you a summary of your performance.

Simple. Like an ugly, featureless version of GuitarHero. (but with a real guitar and an honest purpose: to make you better at
finding chords).

(Please note the project is in its development stage. I'll release a stable version once it...actually works.)
